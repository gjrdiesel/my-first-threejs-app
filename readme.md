# my first threejs app

super quick and dirty hack, just playing around with threejs but it's quite fun.

Hard to believe it but I was kinda inspired by Runescape Classic, someone tagged me in
a facebook post and I thought, how hard would it be to recreate something like that 
with todays web technology.

Turns out, it'd still not be easy as this is as far as I made it in a few hours of messing
around.

## development

on mac, because there is no local web server, you need to open chrome with the `allow-file-access-from-files flag`

```bash
open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
```

using laravel mix/webpack

```bash
npm run dev
```
